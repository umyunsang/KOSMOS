# Conventions

Detailed development conventions for KOSMOS. `AGENTS.md` summarizes the cross-cutting rules; this file is the long form.

## Source code language

All source code text must be in English: comments, docstrings, log messages, error messages, CLI output strings, commit messages, PR titles and bodies, variable and function names.

**Exception**: Korean domain data — real civil-affairs content, legal terms, `data.go.kr` response fields as returned by Korean ministries, citizen-facing example dialogues in design docs — is preserved as-is. Do not translate real data.

Rationale: keeps the project legible to international contributors while respecting that the target domain is Korean.

## Environment variables

All environment variables must be prefixed `KOSMOS_`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KOSMOS_FRIENDLI_TOKEN` | FriendliAI Serverless API token |
| `KOSMOS_DATA_GO_KR_KEY` | data.go.kr API key |
| `KOSMOS_LOG_LEVEL` | stdlib logging level (default `INFO`) |

- Document every required variable in `.env.example`
- Never commit `.env` or any file under `secrets/`
- Never hardcode keys in source, tests, or fixtures

## Logging

- Use stdlib `logging` with module-level loggers: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Default level `INFO`, configurable via `KOSMOS_LOG_LEVEL`
- No `print()` outside the CLI output layer (which uses `rich`)
- Never log personal data, API keys, or full citizen profiles — log IDs and categories only

## Commit messages

KOSMOS uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`

Examples:
```
feat(tools): add KOROAD traffic accident adapter
fix(query-engine): prevent cache invalidation on tool result push
docs(vision): clarify 7-step permission gauntlet
chore(deps): bump httpx to 0.28
```

Rules:
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
- Subject in imperative mood, under 72 characters
- Body explains *why*, not *what* — the diff shows *what*
- Squash noise before opening a PR

## Branches

| Prefix | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feat/<scope>` | new feature |
| `fix/<scope>` | bug fix |
| `docs/<scope>` | documentation only |
| `refactor/<scope>` | internal restructuring |
| `test/<scope>` | tests only |
| `chore/<scope>` | tooling, CI, dependencies |

Examples: `feat/koroad-adapter`, `fix/cache-invalidation`, `docs/vision-layer-3`.

## Pull requests

- Prefer PRs for code changes. Direct commits to `main` are acceptable only for `docs:` and `chore:` changes touching no source code
- Keep PRs focused — a 2,000-line PR touching five layers is hard to review; split it
- Link the issue with `Closes #N`
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Ensure CI is green before requesting review
- Do not force-push after review starts unless asked

## CI checks

All PRs run the following status checks. Ensure CI is green before requesting human review.

### Required checks

| Check | Source | Fail action |
|---|---|---|
| Lint & Type Check | GitHub Actions | Fix lint/type errors |
| Test (Python 3.12) | GitHub Actions | Fix failing tests |
| Test (Python 3.13) | GitHub Actions | Fix failing tests |
| Conventional Commits (PR title) | GitHub Actions | Fix PR title format |
| CodeQL SAST | GitHub Actions | Fix security findings |
| Secret Detection | GitHub Actions | Remove secrets from code |
| Dependency Vulnerability Audit | GitHub Actions | Update vulnerable deps |

### Copilot Review Gate (advisory)

The **Copilot Review Gate** is a custom GitHub App (Cloudflare Worker) that bridges Copilot Code Review into the Checks tab. It is currently **non-required** (advisory).

**How it works:**
1. PR opened → `in_progress` check, waits for Copilot's first review
2. New commits pushed → `in_progress` check + GraphQL `requestReviewsByLogin` triggers Copilot re-review
3. Copilot review arrives → check updated based on severity classification

**Pass/fail criteria (severity-based):**

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| 0 inline comments | **pass** |
| 1+ `🔴 CRITICAL` comments | **fail** |
| 3+ `🟡 IMPORTANT` comments (no critical) | **fail** |
| 1–2 `🟡 IMPORTANT` + any `🟢 SUGGESTION` | **pass** (comments noted) |
| Only `🟢 SUGGESTION` comments | **pass** |

**When the gate fails:**
1. Open the PR **Checks** tab → click **Copilot Review Gate** → read the summary
2. Review Copilot's inline comments on the **Files changed** tab
3. Address critical/important issues, push fixes → Copilot re-reviews automatically
4. The `copilot-review-bypass` label skips the gate (emergency hotfixes only)

**Configuration:**
- Severity prefixes are instructed via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Worker source: `infra/copilot-gate-app/src/index.ts`
- Copilot comments without a recognized prefix default to `🟡 IMPORTANT`

## Git safety

Never:
- `git push --force` on `main`
- `git commit --no-verify` (skip hooks)
- `git commit --no-gpg-sign` (bypass signing)
- `git reset --hard` on published commits
- Amend commits that are already pushed to `main`

## Code style

- **Python**: PEP 8, type-hint public APIs, `ruff` + `mypy` when configured
- **Imports**: stdlib → third-party → local, separated by blank lines
- **Line length**: 100 characters (ruff default)
- **Docstrings**: Google style, one-liner for trivial functions, full form for public APIs
- **Pydantic**: v2 only, never `Any` for tool inputs or outputs
